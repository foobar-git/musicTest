Rationale Document

Simple Web App for streaming music from Spotify using the Spotify SDK and API

Technologies used for this project include:
NodeJS with Express in the back-end, and
Vanilla JavaScript with the EJS viewing engine, utilizing AJAX and Bootstrap CSS.

Laravel was considered, and could prove useful in a possible further development of this idea.
Bootstrap was chosen because of its simplicity and ease of use.
AJAX is mandatory in such a project where we cannot afford page reloads.
NodeJS and Express are excellent tools, even more so as the examples in Spotify's API
have them as examples.
